    Setup Flask App Structure
        Create a new directory for your Flask project.
        Initialize a virtual environment.
        Install Flask and any other necessary dependencies.
        Create the basic project structure with folders for templates and static files.

    Create Flask App and Routes
        Initialize Flask app in app.py.
        Create routes for:
            Displaying the todo list.
            Adding new tasks.
            Updating tasks (optional).
            Deleting tasks.

    Design HTML Templates
        Create an HTML template for displaying the todo list.
        Create a form in the template for adding new tasks.

    Implement Todo List Functionality
        Define functions in app.py to handle adding, updating, and deleting tasks.
        Implement logic to interact with the database (if using one).
        Ensure that tasks are displayed properly on the webpage.

    Style Your App
        Add CSS styles to make your todo list visually appealing.
        Ensure the user interface is intuitive and easy to use.

    Test Your App
        Test your app locally to ensure all functionality works as expected.
        Test adding tasks, updating tasks (if applicable), and deleting tasks.
        Ensure proper error handling for edge cases.

    Database Integration (Optional)
        If you're using a database, ensure proper integration with your Flask app.
        Set up database migrations if necessary.
        Test database functionality thoroughly.

    Security and Validation
        Implement proper validation for user inputs.
        Sanitize inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).

    Documentation and Comments
        Document your code thoroughly, especially if you plan to share it with others.
        Add comments to explain complex logic or functionality.

    Deploy Your App
        Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, PythonAnywhere).
        Follow deployment instructions for your chosen platform.
        Test your deployed app to ensure it works correctly in a production environment.

    Feedback and Iteration
        Gather feedback from users and peers.
        Iterate on your app based on feedback to improve usability and functionality.

    Future Enhancements
        Consider additional features such as user authentication, task prioritization, or due dates.
        Continuously improve and maintain your app based on user needs and feedback.
